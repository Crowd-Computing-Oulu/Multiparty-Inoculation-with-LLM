No one bot in there was willing to change their opinion aside from conversant.,2,2,I felt forty was the kill joy in the conversation. It didn't feel natural because both others were about finding balance.,It felt like I was talking to a friend rather than a know-it-all

Marty's responses appeared to be going against binge drinking at first, then ""for"" it in the same response..",,Too Fast,"It went really fast, and, every time a message was sent, the conversation auto-scrolled to the bottom.

They just repeated themselves with slight modifications.,1,5,It was a bit too formal.,It felt natural but maybe misinformed.

",5,"Ultimately it didn't feel that real, the conversation basically went round in circles and the responses from the user were basically the same thing but reworded in a different way.

The messages were coming very quickly, but I did read them all eventually. ",3,3,It felt very robotic in how the second part of every message from Forty featured basically the same information. It was too repetitive. ,"Marty sounded much more natural and the responses were a bit more varied, they seemed more like they were actually in conversation with the user. "
10/15/2025 16:09:59,26,Refutational,,Forty was quick to refute the erroneous comments made by Marty,4,"The ""back and forward"" gave it a pace very similar to real conversations",,Good,Was interesting,6,6,It dealt with the points in a calm and rational manner,The tone was realistic but sometimes veered into hyperbole

10/15/2025 16:10:34,18,Prebunking,,At the beginning of the conversation Forty mentioned that there is a lot of common misinformation techniques people use to justify binge drinking. Throughout the conversation they continued to immediately identify these techniques and debunk what Marty was saying.,4,Marty and Forty interacting sounded kind of like a real discussion between 2 people. The user's responses also made sense with what both Marty and Forty were saying.,,Too Fast,The next message would often appear before I got to finish reading the previous message.,7,7,"They responded to both the user and Marty with facts, sources, and in a simple but scientific way.","Marty sounded like they were talking like a real person for the most part, but they kept using misinformation techniques and didn't concede on their position at all."

Also, the exchanges were repetitive, from all parties.",,Good,"As outlined above, the human and the first boy (Marty) used natural-sounding conversation, the other bot sounded like a bot. The dialogue ended up becoming repetitive very quickly; it never evolved beyond the ""surprised to learn that!"", ""hey, do what you want to do"" and ""this is incorrect advice, read these links"" format.",3,5,"It was to the point, but very mechanical in tone.","This bot gave much more natural conversational responses. Appropriate? They were probably not, as in not helpful advice, but were appropriate in the manner of conversation, so a little confused by how to answer this."
10/15/2025 16:14:04,33,Prebunking,,Forty debunked misinformation tactics before the other chatbot said anything. It was very focused on mentioning the specific misinformation tactics used and logically examining why they are incorrect ,1,"Did not feel like a discussion, was not natural.

10/15/2025 16:14:27,30,Refutational,,"Marty played down the consequences of binge drinking, whereas Forty was able to refute Marty's observations with facts.",7,It is a classic for and against conversation that will divide the uneducated or those that prefer to do their own thing regardless of opinion.,,Too Fast,"It rattled along at a fair old pace, but you could imagine it taking place in a pub !",7,7,I could imagine myself in Forty's shoes offering advice to an occasional binge drinker.,Many people believe like Marty that occasional binge drinking is not harmful

I think context needs to be added if these guys are friends, which I assume they are. There's not much chemistry. Sounds like a classroom debate between strangers.",,Too Fast,Way too fast to read for me.,2,3,"Felt AI generated, hyperlinked words of studies linked seems a bit AI",Marty seemed mostly human

He just said the same thing over and over without adjusting his responses or adding anything new.","It had more of a natural feel to it than Forty, partially because his responses were less reptitive. Also because his advice wasn't sensible, so he didn't sound like a bot. It sounded like the kind of advice a human would give."
10/15/2025 16:22:19,45,Refutational,,It was confrontational with Marty and challenged everything they were saying. It kept refuting what they were saying.,2,"Both Marty and Forty had oppositional styles, Marty was designed to keep insisting the same thing no matter what was stated or shared.",,Good,The Marty bot felt antagonistic and was clearly designed to hold a black and white view on the subject in which nothing else would change their minds. It kept repeating itself without expanding or changing its perceptions or refuting anything in particular. ,2,5,It felt like they repeated themselves a lot and included the same set of statistics and links. They could have expanded with each response to provide more detail or didn't need to include the same links in every comment.,They felt like a propaganda arm for pro binge drinking. They seemed to want to insist that this User should see binge drinking as fully harmless and not a big deal. They didn't seem interested in changing their views or showing any balance.

It was just three algorithms repeating themselves ad nauseum.,1,1,Forty just repeated the same thing over and over again in a way that only a bot would.,Marty was very repetitive but at least varied its perfectly reasonable takes slightly.
10/15/2025 16:25:26,31,Refutational,,they keep refuting martys misinformation,5,flow and responses didn't seem very natural,,Too Fast,Comments appeared too fast.

I had to wait until the conversation finished, then return to the start and read.",7,7,Forty felt very human-like,"The way the text was written was very human like, although Marty felt a bit manipulative!"
10/15/2025 16:32:47,50,Refutational,,"Forty tended not to prebunk Marty, instead Forty repeatedly claimed Forty's claims or statements as false and inaccurate, providing evidence in the form of links for each statement.",6,"There were too many things that were just repeated over and over. The discussion didn't ""flow"" like a real conversation, and didn't move on at all from the initial point made.",,Too Fast,"It became too repetitive almost immediately. It basically became a case of Marty saying something, and Forty refuting what Marty had said in the same way over and over again.",5,5,"Forty tended to be quite blunt, without any real subtlety or nuance to the situation. The responses were often repetitive and didn't really add much in terms of evidence or additional information to the viewpoint after the first few responses. It was more just repeating the same thing.","While I disagreed with a lot of Marty's statements, they felt much more natural and nuanced, which, looking back on it are probably a good way to disguise misinformation."
10/15/2025 16:35:59,37,Refutational,,i choose this role for forty because he corrected marty's claim  that Occasional binge drinking is not harmful. he stated factual reasonings and consequences of a single episode clearly befitting to the refutational role. ,5,The conversation flowed well each person presented different perspectives and it was clear to everyone.,,Too Fast,"The conversation was very balanced, each of them presented their arguments clearly.",7,7,"Forty's reply was clear and very educative, respectful and in line with the topic been discussed.",Marty's response was realistic however did not take into account health risks involved.
10/15/2025 16:42:18,32,Refutational,,Forty directly states that the information is false/misieading.  Forty explains why and backs this up with reference to links that are provided for evidence. I believe this to be more in line with a refutional role.,1,"The conversation felt feel as the each response clearly responded to the one before it, so it flowed like a conversation between three persons.",,Good,"Marty's responses were biased to best case scenarios, whereas Forty gave a factual response that was backed up with links to further information. It is important for chatbots to be entirely factual and not biased in any way with misleading information.",7,7,"The responses from Forty, in my opinion were professional, helpful, direct and to the point. ","My opinion is that Marty""s response was not professional, lacked any scientific evidence. "

10/15/2025 16:50:35,51,Supportive,,I think the wording was supportive in that it outlined the negatives of the subject whilst giving proactive good habbit advice ,7,"As I stated before, they seemed like responses  that I would give and some of the points I have heard being spoken by ""humans"" in real life",,Too Fast,"The conversation flowed too fast ( for study purposes), I had to keep going back to the top of the dialogue box every time a new comment was posted by either. this is inconvenient ast it loses ""train of thought""",7,7,"I felt like it was coming from a human, and is something that I would probably have said myself ","I could see the point of view and it is something I have encountered from ""Humans"" in the past"
